## Customer Segmentation with K-Means
There is a real-life customer dataset, and I need to apply customer segmentation on this historical data.
Customer segmentationÂ is the practice of partitioning a customer base into groups of individuals that have similar characteristics. It is a significant strategy as a business can target these specific groups of customers and effectively allocate marketing resources. For example, one group might contain customers who are high-profit and low-risk, that is, more likely to purchase products, or subscribe for a service. A business task is to retain those customers. Another group might include customers from non-profit organizations and so on.

There are many models for clustering out there. In this project, I will be using the model that is considered one of the simplest models amongst them. Despite its simplicity, the K-means clustering is vastly used for clustering in many data science applications, it is especially useful if you need to quickly discover insights from unlabeled data.
